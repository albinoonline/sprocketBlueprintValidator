		<p>This is a pre release that will allow you to check for your effective armor protection, just in case i go up in a blazing ball of fire before the tool is finished</p>

			<h2>Armor Displays:</h2>
			<p>This sections shows the weakest armor plate frontally, its been rushed out to help find weak frontal plates, a better version will come soon(tm). Note: it just shows the current weakest plate for each compartment, and just one it encounters, others that are tied for weakest are not shown. Note: your if your turret ring is the thinnest armor a turret plate will not be rendered</p>

			<h2>PATCH NOTES:</h2>
			<h3>1/17/23</h3>
			<h4>Tool Update:</h4>
			<p>Armor Order is now front side rear, rather than front rear side.</p>
			<p>Tool now reads twin transmission option.</p>
			<p>Stat breakdowns are now downloadable as a CSV file, and multiple tanks can now be read at once</p>
			<h3>12/30/22</h3>
			<h4>Tool Update:</h4>
			<p>A canvas (generated image) of the tank is now created, this image shows the weakest plate frontally, or a plate that is tied for the weakest, note this does not display the turret ring, which may be weaker than the toughest plate shown</p>
			<p>The turrets second side armor is now rounded to the nearest hundredth (whoops..., and yes I haven't bothered learning which side is left or right in the code).</p>
			
			<h3>12/28/22</h3>
			<h4>T.E.A.B.A.G. 10 Rule Update:</h4>
			<p>The Aesthetic Appliqu√© Armour Cheat will now be <b>enabled</b> due to exploits, despite the video saying otherwise.</p>
			<h4>T.E.A.B.A.G. 10 Rule Clarification/Tool Update:</h4>
			<p>On the issue of the bottom turret plate, and weaker roof armor under the turret; Hull roof armor (or turret roof if you want a pancake turret) must be to spec (15mm), but the underside of the turret no longer has to be, the tool will now ignore plates that are both on a turret, and whoos points "up" value are exactly 0 (you can check by selecting the point, and opening the position tab).</p>
			<p>Note: Mantlet armor does not count as valid armor due to it not changing weight, be sure that the plate(s) behind the mantled are of effective armor, the tool does not read mantlet armor.</p>
			<h4>Tool Update:</h4>
			<p>Output values are now rounded to the nearest hundredth.</p>
			<p>Width now says raw is hull and simplified is track.</p>
